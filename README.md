# homepageWD036

- Nike homepage
The goal was to be as closed as possible to the main page.

- the homepage has been divided into 3 sections: 
1- Top Nav + Hero section ---> Floriane
2- 3 middle sections ---> Stephan
3- Round pictures + footers ----> Momtaz


How did we do? 
1- Creation of repo + push index and css style
Creation of different folder for the images and other material
2- Stephan push into html a skeleton of the page with the different part <header>, < hero>, <section>, etc. 
3- Each member had to pull the repo and push it again when done

Main issues: 
1- We all modified the <body> section which created conflict -> solved when merging
2- One of us did not use the skeleton which lead to some issues when pushing -> had to pull the repository and replace by the correct files
+ copy/paste the section to the right place
